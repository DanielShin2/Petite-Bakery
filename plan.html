  <h2>Petite Treats</h2>
  <p style="padding-left: 1em;  font-size: 20px">
    We are a small family-run local business, operating in Kirwan since 2012, hoping to improve our
business by getting on the Internet. Our bakery is located at 123 Prize Lane in Kirwan, Queensland.
We specialise in traditional Australian baked goods. We are currently in the process of getting some
images created, so please just choose some ones for placeholders at the moment so we can see
what it will look like.
We have customers of all ages, however, we would like to attract young families and young people,
possibly around the age of 17 – 35, to our bakery. From what we saw from other websites, we think
we probably need 7 – 8 pages for our site with the following:</p>
<h2>Navigation</h2>
<p style="padding-left: 1em;  font-size: 20px">
 Navigation – Should use a horizontal navigation at the top. Links should be repeated in the
footer.</p>
<h2>Home Page</h2>
<p style="padding-left: 1em;  font-size: 20px">
 Home page – should be very appealing and drive interest in our bakery. We also want to
show some sample images of the products to be displayed to attract the site visitors’
attention.
o We want our customers to be able to sign up for weekly specials! We think there
should be a page for our weekly specials to further attract customers.
o The home page should highlight these two customers comments:
“Petite Treats has the best cheesecake I’ve ever had. Always fresh, and melts in the
mouth. Would recommend highly!”
“I’m addicted to the Danish pastries and always drop in here on my way to work.” </p>
<h2>About me</h2>
