  <h2>Petite Treats</h2>
  <p style="padding-left: 1em;  font-size: 20px">
    We are a small family-run local business, operating in Kirwan since 2012, hoping to improve our
business by getting on the Internet. Our bakery is located at 123 Prize Lane in Kirwan, Queensland.
We specialise in traditional Australian baked goods. We are currently in the process of getting some
images created, so please just choose some ones for placeholders at the moment so we can see
what it will look like.
We have customers of all ages, however, we would like to attract young families and young people,
possibly around the age of 17 – 35, to our bakery. From what we saw from other websites, we think
we probably need 7 – 8 pages for our site with the following:</p>
<h2>Navigation</h2>
<p style="padding-left: 1em;  font-size: 20px">
 Navigation – Should use a horizontal navigation at the top. Links should be repeated in the
footer.</p>
<h2>Home Page</h2>
<p style="padding-left: 1em;  font-size: 20px">
 Home page – should be very appealing and drive interest in our bakery. We also want to
show some sample images of the products to be displayed to attract the site visitors’
attention.
o We want our customers to be able to sign up for weekly specials! We think there
should be a page for our weekly specials to further attract customers.
o The home page should highlight these two customers comments:
“Petite Treats has the best cheesecake I’ve ever had. Always fresh, and melts in the
mouth. Would recommend highly!”
“I’m addicted to the Danish pastries and always drop in here on my way to work.” </p>
<h2>About me</h2>
<p style="padding-left: 1em;  font-size: 20px">

baker is an artisan-baker and was trained in Paris. Some of our current customers are James

<h2>Website Sketch</h2>

<h2>Project Report</h2>
<p style="padding-left: 1em; font-size: 20px; color:black">
What is your first impression of the website?
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 1em; font-size: 20px; color:black">
    For the first impression of the website, I asked 3 of my friends to view my website so I could get feedbacks and the feedbacks were mostly positive. All of them said it looked really good comparing to theirs. But they also commented that I lack some detail designs, like signup form. And yet, the website looks good.
<p style="padding-left: 1em; font-size: 20px; color:black">
    To tackle this problem, I will make sure that I will try to improve on some details.
</p>
<h2>Are there any errors in this website?</h2>
<p style="padding-left: 1em; font-size: 20px; color:black">
    I asked three of my friends and the feedbacks were quite satisfying. Only one of them did respond an error that every individual menu lacks some designs and colors. And the rest respond no error at all.
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 1em; font-size: 20px; color:black">
    For that problem, I did put a background image as blur but it turned out the image never appears. For me, it look quite good with or without the background image. That's why I did not try to fix it.
<h2>Is the website easy to use?</h2>
<p style="padding-left: 1em; font-size: 20px; color:black">
    My feedbacks said that the website was quite simple and easy to use. And the colors and photos do match with the website.
</p>
<h2>How likely are you to return to this website on your own?</h2>
<p style="padding-left: 1em; font-size: 20px; color:black">
    One of them said he will not be visiting this site again since he is not a foodie guy. And the other two even said my website even made them hugry.
</p>
<h2>Does the site images take a long time to display</h2>
<p style="padding-left: 1em; font-size: 20px; color:black">
    Well, yes they said. The big one from the home page as well as some big size photos like the ones on the banners took like 3 to 4 seconds to upload.
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 1em; font-size: 20px; color:black">
    For this problem, I will be using normal size photos instaed of a big image taking most of the space.
</p>
<h2>How easy can you reestablish proficiency?</h2>
<p style="padding-left: 1em; font-size: 20px; color:black">
    All of the feedbacks said that the website was really easy to remember as it is simple and clear to use.
</p>
<h2>Any comments on user experience from the tester></h2>
<p style="padding-left: 1em; font-size: 20px; color:black">
    The feedbacks suggest for lack of some colors and design in detail areas. It didn't seem quite much at the first glance. But it does look the website uglier. And about the signup form, I will try to improve on it.
